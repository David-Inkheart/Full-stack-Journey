### Project Reflections:

- Parcel helps to automatically bundle and run typscript files. It also helps to run the project on a local server. Parcel is a great tool to use for small projects like this one.

- I used the Google Maps API to create the map and add markers to it. I used the Geolocation API to get the user's current location.
