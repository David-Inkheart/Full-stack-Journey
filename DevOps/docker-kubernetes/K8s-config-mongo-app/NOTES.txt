Deployment and Service configuration are both in the same file. This can be done for small projects, since they are not likely to change often and they are both related to the same project. However, for larger projects, it is better to separate them into different files. This way, you can change the Service configuration without having to redeploy the application.

They are both in mongo-deployment.yaml file. The Service configuration is in the last part of the file.
